LIGHT BY DAN
Queer/colourful/celebratory/surreal (spinner) portrait photography in London

Hi I’m Dan!

I create queer surreal portrait photography in East London, focusing on celebrating vulnerability and joy, and leaning into the absurdety of the situation.


 Most of my subjects are friends but many have been commisions too, <link>

Hello and welcome! My name’s Dan, and I made this site and all the images on it. 

Edinburgh born, London based, I’m equal parts Scottish, English, Spanish and Italian.

fueled by a curious eye and inspired by the queer icons and collectives of East London.


## Nightlife
I started out with simple snapshots of nights out in 2008, when it was my mission to try and capture those beautiful split-second moments of unguarded joy (whilst skipping some of the mess). This continued when I moved to proper club photography in 2012, and even when I changed to shooting mostly drag and cabaret performers it was always about capturing situations rather than things, looking for people’s reactions and the fun in the moment.

## Portraiture
In ten years of taking hundreds of thousands of photos documenting queer nightlife (and deleting most of them), I’ve learned a lot about fun, queer culture, and how people see themselves. For the last couple of years I’ve tried to bring a lot of that to my portraiture, keeping an irreverence and a sense of fun, leaning into the ridiculousness and the fantasy of it, not getting bogged down in tiresome gender preconceptions, and focusing more on the person and their character. After all it’s all just a different point of view, but no less true for that.

# Exhibitions
### Living Vivid
After a year of shooting performer friends, I had an opportunity to show an exhibition at Dalston Superstore; 40 portraits of kings and queens displayed for 2 months in the same scene that most of them came up in. It was a collaborative crusade to learn from, signal-boost and celebrate some of the local queer icons. 



# About shoots

Hi there!
I do cute portraits of people under colourful lights; a celebratory and fantastical take in a sea of standardised humdrum.

Thinking of booking your own shoot? It’s great for self-promotion if you’re a performer, creative or an online brand, but it’s also a fun experience for exploring and improving self-image in a safe environment. Vulnerability and trust is as much a part of it for me as discovery and laughter.




## How does it work?
Come to my home in Mile End where I’ll have turned the top floor into a pop-up studio, I’ll start by offering you some tea and talking you through the shoot; hopes, fears, expectations, and self image.
Depending on how much time you book in we’ll work through a variety of lighting setups, colours, props and poses. I’ll show you some photos as we go, so you can get a sense of how things are turning out and we can change direction as needed.

In the week after the shoot I’ll spend time working through the photos, making basic edits and whittling from hundreds to dozens, sending you a gallery of the set so you can select the ones you want (and also which you want deleted for all time).

Finally I spruce the chosen ones up and send them to you in high resolution. If you give the go ahead I might use some on my Instagram or websites too!
