LIGHT BY DAN
Queer colourful portrait photography in London

Hi I’m Dan!
I create queer surreal portrait photography in East London, focusing on celebrating vulnerability and joy. I specialise in super amateur stuff with people who don’t fit masc architypes, but I’ll try my hand at anything!
Here you can see (a lot) of my work, find out more about me, learn about booking your own shoot, or get in touch!
You can also follow me on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

## Bio
My name’s Dan, I’m vaguely equal parts Scottish, English, Spanish and Italian, and to say my full name you have to use at least 3 different accents. I was born in Edinburgh but I’ve lived in London for 15 years now. As befits a nerdy introvert (check out my old blog) my day job and main profession is a front end web developer, photography’s just been a hobby that’s grown WILDLY out of control, fueled by a curious eye and inspired by the queer icons and collectives of East London.


## Nightlife
I started out with simple snapshots of nights out in 2008, when it was my mission to try and capture those beautiful split-second moments of unguarded joy (whilst skipping some of the mess). This continued when I moved to proper club photography in 2012, and even when I changed to shooting mostly drag and cabaret performers it was always about capturing situations rather than things, looking for people’s reactions and the fun in the moment.

## Portraiture
In ten years of taking hundreds of thousands of photos documenting queer nightlife (and deleting most of them), I’ve learned a lot about fun, queer culture, and how people see themselves. For the last couple of years I’ve tried to bring a lot of that to my portraiture, keeping an irreverence and a sense of fun, leaning into the ridiculousness and the fantasy of it, not getting bogged down in tiresome gender preconceptions, and focusing more on the person and their character. After all it’s all just a different point of view, but no less true for that.

## Exhibitions
After a year of shooting friends who were performers on the east London drag circuit, I heard of an opportunity to show an exhibition at Dalston Superstore which was pretty awesome. 40 portraits of kings and queens displayed in the scene that most of them came up in. It was a collaborative crusade to learn from, signal-boost and celebrate some of the local queer icons out there writing their own rule books. The exhibition ran for two months at Dalston Superstore in Autumn 2018, though it being my first I didn’t really capitalise on it, and I’ve no idea how to do something similar again!

# About shoots

Hi there!
I do cute portraits of people under colourful lights; a celebratory and fantastical take in a sea of standardised humdrum.

Thinking of booking your own shoot? It’s great for self-promotion if you’re a performer, creative or an online brand, but it’s also a fun experience for exploring and improving self-image in a safe environment. Vulnerability and trust is as much a part of it for me as discovery and laughter.

Now taking bookings for January!

## How does it work?
Come to my home in Mile End where I’ll have turned the top floor into a pop-up studio, I’ll start by offering you some tea and talking you through the shoot; hopes, fears, expectations, and self image.
Depending on how much time you book in we’ll work through a variety of lighting setups, colours, props and poses. I’ll show you some photos as we go, so you can get a sense of how things are turning out and we can change direction as needed.

After the shoot, I’ll spend some time working through the photos, making basic edits and whittling them from hundreds to dozens.

I’ll send you proofs of those that worked so you can select the ones you want edited and delivered, and also which ones you want deleted for all time.

Finally I spruce the chosen ones up and send them to you in high resolution, either via email or my website. If you give the go ahead I might use some on my Instagram or websites too!
