    <h1>Meet Dan</h1>

    <p>
      Hello and welcome! My name’s Dan, and I made this site and all the images
      on it. I create queer surreal portrait photography in East London,
      focusing on celebrating vulnerability, joy, and the sheer absurdety of the
      situation.

    <h2>Nightlife</h2>
    <p>
      I started out in 2008 documenting nights out, my mission to capture those
      beautiful moments of unguarded joy (whilst skipping some of the mess). I
      moved to "proper" club photography in 2012, then changed to shooting
      mostly drag and cabaret performers. It was always about capturing
      situations rather than things, looking for people’s reactions and the fun
      in the moment.

    <h2>Portraiture</h2>
    <p>
      In ten years of taking hundreds of thousands of photos of queer nightlife
      (and deleting most of them), I’ve learned a lot about fun, queer culture,
      and how people see themselves. I’ve tried to bring that to my portraiture,
      keeping an irreverence and a sense of fun, leaning into the ridiculousness
      and the fantasy of it, not getting bogged down in tiresome gender
      preconceptions, and focusing more on the person and their character. After
      all it’s all just a different point of view, but no less true for that.
