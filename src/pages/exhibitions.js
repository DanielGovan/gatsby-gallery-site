    <p>
      After a year of shooting performer friends, I had an opportunity to show
      an exhibition at Dalston Superstore; 40 portraits of kings and queens
      displayed for 2 months in the same scene that most of them came up in. It
      was a collaborative crusade to learn from, signal-boost and celebrate some
      of the local queer icons.{" "}
