    <h1>Shooting with Light By Dan</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! I do cute portraits of people under colourful lights; a
      celebratory and fantastical take in a sea of standardised humdrum.
      Vulnerability and trust is as much a part of it for me as discovery and
      laughter.
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      Arrive at my home in Mile End where I’ll have turned the top floor into a
      pop-up studio, I’ll start by offering you some tea and talking you through
      the shoot; hopes, fears, expectations, and self image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on how much time you book in we’ll work through a variety of
      lighting setups, colours, props and poses. I’ll show you some photos as we
      go, so you can get a sense of how things are turning out and we can change
      direction as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the week after the shoot I’ll spend time working through the photos,
      making basic edits and whittling from hundreds to dozens, sending you a
      gallery of the set so you can select the ones you want (and also which you
      want deleted for all time).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally I spruce the chosen ones up and send them to you in high
      resolution. If you give the go ahead I might use some on my Instagram or
      websites too!
    </p>
