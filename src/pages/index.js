          Hi there! My nameâ€™s Dan, and I do cute portraits of people with
          colourful lights in East London. I call it Light By Dan
        </Para>
        <Para>
          Before portraits I took hundreds of thousands of photos of queer
          nightlife over 10 years (and deleting most of them), so I learned a
          lot about queer culture and how people see themselves.

          I try to keep a similar vibe in my shoots; fun, irreverant, maybe a
          little fantastical. Not getting too bogged down in preconceptions or
          the humdrum, instead focusing on the person and their character, and
          always celebrating vulnerability, absurdity and joy
